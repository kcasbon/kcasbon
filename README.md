## ℹ️ About Me

I’m an interdisciplinary builder passionate about using **software** and **data science** to answer big questions — from how galaxies evolve to how we interact with the digital world. I’ve developed full-stack platforms, built custom database engines, and applied **deep learning** to astronomical data. Whether it’s infrastructure or insight, I enjoy creating tools that scale.
